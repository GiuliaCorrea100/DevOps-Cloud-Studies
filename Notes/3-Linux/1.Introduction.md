### **1. Why Linux matters for DevOps**

- **Foundation of DevOps:** Most servers and cloud environments run on Linux.
- **Automation-friendly:** Easier to script and automate compared to Windows.
- **Open source:** Huge community, constant updates, highly customizable.
- **Secure and scalable:** Used everywhere, from supercomputers to Android.

### **2. What you actually need to master**

Four main areas:

1. **Commands** – navigating the system, copying/moving files, editing text.
2. **Files** – permissions, filters, redirection.
3. **Software** – installing and managing packages (RPM vs DEB).
4. **Servers** – setting up web and database servers on Linux.

### **3. Key Linux principles**

- **Everything is a file:** Hardware (keyboard, mouse) is treated like a file.
- **Small programs, big workflows:** Simple commands can be combined to do complex tasks (great for automation).
- **Text-based configuration:** Settings are in text files, easy to edit and automate.
- **Avoid GUI dependency:** Command line > clicking buttons.

### **4. Open source explained (quickly)**

- Code is public → anyone can improve it → better, faster innovation.
- Linux exists because Linus Torvalds released the kernel in 1991.
- **Flavors of Linux (distros):** All share the same kernel but add different tools.

### **5. Distros you actually care about**

- **Debian-based (Ubuntu):** Easy, modern, great for DevOps.
- **RPM-based (Red Hat, CentOS, Amazon Linux):** Stable, secure, popular for enterprise servers.
- Main difference? **Package formats**: `.deb` vs `.rpm`.

### **6. Basic Linux architecture**

- **Hardware → Kernel → Shell → Tools/Programs → You**
- Kernel is the “engine,” shell is how you “talk” to it.

### **7. Key directories to know**

- `/home` – user files
- `/root` – admin (superuser) home
- `/bin` & `/usr/bin` – basic commands
- `/sbin` – admin commands
- `/etc` – configuration files (important!)
- `/var` – server data (websites, databases)
- `/tmp` – temporary stuff
- `/boot` – boot files
- `/proc` & `/sys` – system info
