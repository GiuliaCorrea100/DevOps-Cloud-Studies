### Root and Regular Users

- When you log into your Linux machine via `vagrant ssh`, you start as the **vagrant user**.
- If you type `sudo -i`, you switch to the **root user**.
- If you type `exit`, you log out from root and return to the vagrant user.
- Typing `exit` once more logs you out completely and returns you to your Windows machine.

**Tip:** Switching back and forth between users is normal while practicing. Use `sudo -i` for administrative tasks, and `exit` to return.

---

### Creating Directories

- Use `mkdir` to create directories:

```bash
mkdir dev
mkdir ops
mkdir backup
```

---

### Creating Empty Files

- Use `touch` to create an empty file:

```bash
touch testfile.txt
```

- You can also create multiple files at once:

```bash
touch devopsfile{1..10}.txt
```

This creates `devopsfile1.txt` through `devopsfile10.txt`.

---

### Copy with Relative Paths

```bash
cp devopsfile1.txt dev/
ls dev/
```

This copies the file to the **dev** folder.

### Copy with Absolute Paths

```bash
cp /home/vagrant/devopsfile2.txt /home/vagrant/dev/
```

Absolute paths are safer when you’re new, because they remove confusion about where you are in the filesystem.

**Relative Path**: `dev/` (from your current folder)

**Absolute Path**: `/home/vagrant/dev/` (complete path from the root `/`)

---

### **Copying Directories**

If you try:

```bash
cp dev backup/
```

You’ll get an error: *omitting directory*.

To copy directories, use `-r` (recursive):

```bash
cp -r dev backup/
```

---

### **Understanding Command Syntax**

General Linux command format:

command [options] [arguments]

- **Command**: The tool you run (e.g., `cp`, `ls`, `mv`)
- **Options**: Flags that modify behavior (e.g., `r`, `l`, `f`)
- **Arguments**: Targets for the command (files, directories, paths)

Example:

```bash
cp -r dev backup/
```

- `cp` → the command
- `r` → the option (recursive)
- `dev backup/` → the arguments (source and destination)

Use `--help` to explore options:

```bash
cp --help
```

---

### **Moving and Renaming Files**

- Moving a file:

```bash
mv devopsfile3.txt ops/
```

- Moving a directory:

```bash
mv ops dev/
```

- Renaming a file:

```bash
mv testfile.txt testfile22.txt
```

---

### **Wildcards and Bulk Actions**

- The  (asterisk) is a **wildcard**:

```bash
mv *.txt textdir/
```

This moves all `.txt` files to **textdir**.

---

### **Deleting Files and Directories**

- Remove a file:

```bash
rm devopsfile10.txt
```

- Remove a directory (recursive):

```bash
rm -r mobile/
```

- Remove everything in the current folder:

```bash
rm -rf *
```

**Danger!**

`rm -rf *` permanently deletes **all files and directories** in your current location. There is **no recycle bin** in Linux. Always double-check with `pwd` before running it.
