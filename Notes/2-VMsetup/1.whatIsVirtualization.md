## What Is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of **partitioning a physical resource** (like a server) into **multiple virtual resources**.

You can think of it as creating **baby computers**‚Äîvirtual machines (VMs)‚Äîinside a single real computer. Each VM behaves like an independent computer, with its **own operating system** and **its own isolated environment**.

Types of virtualization go beyond servers:

- **Server virtualization ! - virtual machines**.
- **Network virtualization**
- **Storage virtualization**

## The Virtualization Stack

Let‚Äôs look at the architecture of virtualization:

1. **Hardware** ‚Äì The physical computer or server.
2. **Hypervisor** ‚Äì The software that creates and runs virtual machines.
3. **Virtual Machines (VMs)** ‚Äì Each with its own **guest operating system** and applications.

This allows each VM to run independently, just like separate computers.

## Key Terminologies

To help you navigate this new world, here are some important terms:

- **Host Operating System (Host OS)**: The OS running on the physical machine.
- **Guest Operating System (Guest OS)**: The OS running inside the virtual machine.
- **VM**: Short for *Virtual Machine*, a simulated computer running within the host.
- **Snapshot**: A backup or ‚Äúfrozen state‚Äù of a virtual machine at a specific point in time.
- **Hypervisor**: The software that enables virtualization by managing and creating virtual machines.

## Types of Hypervisors

There are two main types of hypervisors:

### üîπ Type 1 ‚Äì Bare Metal Hypervisors

These run **directly on the physical hardware**, without a host operating system. They're used in production environments and provide better performance.

**Examples**:

- VMware ESXi
- Xen Hypervisor

These hypervisors support **clustering**, where VMs can move between physical machines. If one hypervisor fails, another can take over‚Äîensuring uptime.

### üîπ Type 2 ‚Äì Hosted Hypervisors

These run **as software** within a host OS‚Äîjust like any other app you install. They are used primarily for **testing and learning**.

**Examples**:

- Oracle VM VirtualBox (used in this course)
- VMware Workstation or VMware Server

Just a tip: **Microsoft Hyper-V**, though it appears to be a Type 2 hypervisor, is actually a **Type 1**.
